 The test consists in building 2 endpoints:

## 1. Webhook Endpoint

The Webhook endpoint receives events from Github and saves them on the database, in order to do that you must read the following docs:

* Webhooks Overview: https://developer.github.com/webhooks/ 
* Creating Webhooks : https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/

## 2. Events Endpoint

The Events endpoint will expose the persist the events by an api that will filter by issue number

**Request:**

> GET /issues/1000/events

**Response:**

> 200 OK
```javascript
[ 
  { "action": "open", created_at: "...",}, 
  { "action": "closed", created_at: "...",} 
]
```

**Github Integration Instructions**

* Tip: You can use ngrok (https://ngrok.com/)  to install / debug the webhook calls, it generates a public url that will route to your local host:

   $ sudo ngrok http 4000
